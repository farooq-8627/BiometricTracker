# Device Pairing System

The system implements a robust device pairing mechanism between mobile devices and laptops, managed through [public/mobile.js](mdc:public/mobile.js).

## Pairing Process

1. **Discovery**
   - Mobile devices discover available laptops
   - Laptops are displayed with truncated IDs
   - Real-time updates for laptop availability

2. **Connection Establishment**
   - Primary WebSocket connection with Socket.io fallback
   - Automatic reconnection handling
   - Connection status monitoring

3. **Pairing Protocol**
   - Two-way confirmation required
   - Queue system for multiple pairing requests
   - Automatic cleanup of stale requests

## Security Considerations

- Pairing requires explicit user confirmation
- Connection tokens are validated
- Paired connections are maintained until explicitly terminated

## UI Integration

- Real-time status updates
- Clear visual indicators of connection state
- Easy-to-use pairing interface
- Feedback for all pairing actions

## Error Recovery

- Automatic reconnection attempts
- Graceful handling of disconnections
- Clear user feedback on connection issues
- Maintenance of pairing state during temporary disconnections
